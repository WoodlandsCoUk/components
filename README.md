# Woodlands.co.uk Component Library

the component library. Follow the links in the command line output to view the website.

```cli
npm start
```

### Compile assets

component library to reflect the changes. This is done using;

```cli
npm run build
```

are saved and automatically refresh the component library page youâ€™re viewing.

```cli
npm run watch
```

```

}
```
